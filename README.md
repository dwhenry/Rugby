# Points tipper

This is a simple game app where the goal of the game is to 
get the smallest number of points.

This is essential a tipping game, and while it was initially
built for the rugby world cup (RWC) there is no reason it
could not be used for any other competitive competition.

Feel free to submit pull requests to make it work for your 
specific game.

## How it works

1. Pick the winning side.
2. Pick the winning margin.
3. Get a point for the difference between your guess and 
the actual margin.
4. Get 10 penalty points if you pick the wrong winning team.
5. Get 10 points taken off if you get the exact margin.

He who has the lowest score wins.
